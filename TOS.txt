# 🤐 Anti-Yapinator: The Ultimate Interruption Bot

Tired of people talking too much in voice chat? **Anti-Yapinator** is here to help! This silly Discord bot lurks in voice channels and **rudely interrupts** a chosen target whenever they dare to speak. A perfect tool for *absolute chaos* or just some harmless fun.  

## 🎤 What Does It Do?
- **Joins a voice channel** and spies (uh, I mean… listens).  
- **Plays a loud, obnoxious sound** whenever the target user talks.  
- **Automatically disconnects** if nobody is around to be annoyed.  
- **Customizable access** so only authorized users can wield its disruptive power.  

## ⚠️ Warning  
Use responsibly. Or don’t. I’m not your boss.
